      <p>A <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#timer"><code>role=timer</code></a> is a live region with an implicit <code>aria-live=off</code>.</p>
      <p>An <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#aria-live"><code>aria-live=off</code></a> 
        is not meant to announce dynamic changes "unless the user is currently focused on that region".</p>
      <p>The following test has a <code>role=timer</code> with a <code>tabindex=0</code> to allow for testing with Virtual Cursor "focus" as well as keyboard focus.</p>

      <div class="test">

            const timer = document.querySelector('[role=timer]');
            let maxTime = 60 * 5;

            function startTimer ( duration ) {
              counter = duration;
              let minutes;
              let seconds;

              setInterval ( function () {
                minutes = parseInt(counter / 60, 10);
                seconds = parseInt(counter % 60, 10);

                minutes = minutes < 10 ? + minutes : minutes;
                seconds = seconds < 10 ? "0" + seconds : seconds;

                timer.textContent = minutes + ':' + seconds;

                if ( --counter < 0 ) {
                  counter = duration;

                  <li>Narrator with Win10 and Edge 98: updates not announced when focused with VC or keyboard focus. Timer role announced.</li>

                  <li>Android 12 TalkBack with Firefox 95.2: updates announced while VC focus remains on element. Timer role not announced.</li>
                  <li>Android 12 TalkBack with Chrome 96: updates not announced when focused with VC. Timer role announced.</li>
                  
                  <li>iOS 15.3.1 VoiceOver with Safari: no announcement of dynamic content. Is difficult to swipe to the dynamically updating content. VO focus will often skip over the countdown timer (nothing to do with the role. iOS VO just doesn't seem to like moving focus to content that updates so frequently). Timer role not announced.</li>
